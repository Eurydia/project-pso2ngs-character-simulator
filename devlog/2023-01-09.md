Today, I want to add the classes and class skills.
The classes should be easy to implement since their stats are unconditional.

However, I think the skills are much harder to implement.
Some require other skills to unlock.
Some need to be activated.
Some only activates after other skills expires.

This issue can be solved by adding more context but I am hesitant to do so.

One thing I will do for certain is to intentionally ignore skills which are irrelevent to the planner.

I will add non-weapon skills.
If a skill only interact with a weapon or a photon art, then I will ignore it.

My candidates are passive skills and some active skills.

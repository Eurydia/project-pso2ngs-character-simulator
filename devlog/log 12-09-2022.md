## Note

### Overview panel should be on every page

I want to make sure each page has its own "overview" panel.
For that I need to make the overview component "global".
This should be easy enough since I have implemented the correct way.

I need to also make sure that the props make sense.

One way that I think should work nicely is to create a custom `useState` hook.
Maybe extend from the `atomWithStorage` from Jotai.

### Handling stats

For the stats "entity" I will use the same approach.
Each stat of a character will be a member of an enum object.
This time, enum object will be a number enum, instead of a string enum.

E.g.

```ts

enum Stat {
    BP = 0,
    HP,
    PP,
    ATK,
    DEF,

}

```
